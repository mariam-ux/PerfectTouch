                    <p>After years of experience and hard work in the events industry and driven by his ambition Ahmad El Basha started Perfect touch in the year 2018 with a great determination and belief that he could compete in the market of Doha.</p>
                    <p>PERFECT TOUCH is not any events agency, it became a community that is far from toxicity and competition, instead it is fulfilled with a helpful team that works on projects as if they were theirs. Slowly but surely, the company started expanding its departments and specialties which made it a multidisciplinary hub that offers any client everything they need to succeed.</p>
